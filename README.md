# Project Title
Customer Segmentation Prediction

# Project Description
Marketing campaigns are characterized by focusing on customer needs and their overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, there are different variables that determine whether a marketing campaign will be successful or not. Some important aspects of a marketing campaign are as follows:

Segment of the Population: To which segment of the population is the marketing campaign going to address and why? This aspect of the marketing campaign is extremely important since it will tell which part of the population should most likely receive the message of the marketing campaign.

Distribution channel to reach the customer's place: Implementing the most effective strategy in order to get the most out of this marketing campaign. What segment of the population should we address? Which instrument should we use to get our message out? (Ex: Telephones, Radio, TV, Social Media Etc.)

Promotional Strategy: This is the way the strategy is going to be implemented and how are potential clients going to be addressed. This should be the last part of the marketing campaign analysis since there has to be an in-depth analysis of previous campaigns (If possible) in order to learn from previous mistakes and to determine how to make the marketing campaign much more effective.

Recently, there has been a decline in revenue for the bank and investigation has been carried out to identify the root of the problem. The bank found out that the reduce in revenue is mainly due to decrement of the deposition of money into the bank by the clients. Hence, the bank decided to conduct marketing campaigns to persuade more clients to deposit money into the bank.

Our job as data analysts cum deep learning engineer is to develop a deep learning model to predict the outcome of the campaign. The purpose of marketing campaign is to collect customer’s needs and overall satisfaction. There are a few essential aspects of the marketing campaign namely, customer segmentation, promotional strategy, and etc. Correctly identified strategy may help to expand and grow the bank’s revenue.

# Data Description
Customer segmentation is a process to dividing customers into groups which possess common characteristics based on their age, gender, profession as well as interests. By doing so will enable the company to gain insights of customer’s needs or preferences, therefore the company will design a marketing strategy to target the most profitable segments.

Here we only focus on Train dataset. 
Train set contains the data to be used for model building. 
It has the true labels for whether the customer subscribed for term deposit (1) or not (0)
